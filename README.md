#### SmartClass
A classroom app made for students and teachers for better interaction - Haxplore 19[team - HX001]

#### Inspiration

Our inspiration is based on our personal experiences at school. Each day of each class, we receive a new lesson and new content to learn. When we have classes consisting of 30 people(or more), there will always be people who do not understand or have questions to ask. However, these people may be shy, or are afraid to ask a question. Students want to learn and teach their students to succeed. However, being shy to ask can prevent students from asking questions or telling what they really understand. Education professionals have been trying to solve this problem for years, so we decided to design our smartkaksha solution

It anonymously shares this data with teachers so they can adjust mid-lecture or look back later to see what confused students most.
